(In Articles 15 and 17, you, the ConchGame and any members of the ConchGame group of companies may be referred to individually as "one party" or collectively as the "agreement party.")

The rules of arbitration are not the same as the rules of court litigation. Moreover, arbitration is not as formal as court proceedings, and arbitration provides only a limited opportunity to force the other party to share information related to the dispute. This process is called "disclosure." The arbitrator may make the same damages and remedies as the court against the individual. However, if either party does not approve the arbitrator's decision, the court has limited ability to make changes to the outcome of the arbitration or to request an arbitrator to review it.

    
If either party has a different opinion on whether the arbitration agreement can be enforced or whether it applies to the resolution of our disputes, the parties agree that the arbitrator will also make a judgment.

    
Also, if you, ConchGame or ConchGame         The members of the company group filed a claim against the court for arbitration, or either party refused to arbitrate the claim for arbitration, and the other party may request the court to force the parties to settle the claim through arbitration (ie, compulsory arbitration). You, ConchGame or         Members of the ConchGame group may also request the court to stop the proceedings (ie, retain the proceedings) when performing the arbitral proceedings.

#### Exceptions to the arbitration agreements

All parties agree that they seek resolution from the court     

    
        
	1.Intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents) about members of you, ConchGame or ConchGame;         
        
	2About any violation of the Community Rules; or   For more information on how to choose a court to resolve such disputes, please see Article 17 ("Resolved Sites for Arbitration of Legal Disputes").


#### No class action can be filed
By accepting these terms voluntarily (and in many of our services, by affirmatively clicking or clicking a button in the game to affirmatively you agree to these terms), you, ConchGame and ConchGame                 The group of companies agrees that the parties can only file claims against each other on an individual basis.
